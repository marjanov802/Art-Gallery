Studies in visual saliency indicate that central , bold or INTERACTIVE elements like a glibe command attention more effecitivly than peripheral content.
Users instinctively gravitate toward prominent focal points, especially those that engage them with motion or interacitity.
Abobe research in attraction:

By making the globe interactive , allowing users to rotate and zoom, you are further enchancing the engagement through exploration which has been shown to hold attention longer

NAVIGATION BAR:
OPTIONS ARE TO CREATE A NAVIGATION BAR WITH EVERYTHING OR A FILTERS BUTTON WITH THE FILTERS AND THE NAVIGATION BAR TO BE MORE IMPORTATNT INFORMATION.
will create two wireframes
Filter button seems better due to proressive disclouser- showing only essential items at first.
Hiding the filters behind reduces cognitive load- research shows that progressive disclousure improves usability by revealing information gradually, allowing users to focus on one task at a time:

NAVIGATION BAR MAY WORK IF YOU HAVE A FEW FILTERS HWOEVER THIS IS MORE COMPLEX SO A MODAL IS MORE APPROPRITE.

The navigation will be at the top of the page currently- however if the top of the page feels to crwoded with the globe pushing it up the navigation will be moved to the left of the page.
We will have to decide on the navigation layout once we have seen how bug the globe is and in the wireframes
