MONOCHROME WEBPAGE:
How people read on the web is highly contingent upon:

Their task
Their assumptions from previous experiences with the internet, site, or brand
The page layout
The type of page content (e.g., text versus images)

F-Pattern - No subheadings or bullet points users fixate on words towards the beginning of lines and at the top of the page, resemebles F

Spotted Pattern - User chooses words or chinls spread in page because they visually standout, text styled , links , different colours bold or bullet list , or they remeber a word that the user looks for to accomplish current task.
e.g captial letter for address, digits for a piece of numeric information

Layer-Cake scanning pattern:
consitis of fixations placed mostly on the pages heading and subheadings, until users locate the heading that htey are interested in , then they read the body text below.

Commitment pattern:
read everyword and all content becuase they are motivated to read the content
motivated because - loyal to the brand , know and trust the source, believe it is the best place to find the information


EYE MOVEMENTS: 
F-pattern for traditional more text heavy pages
Z-pattern for other types of content , typically adverts or website home pages with less text

Eye naturally drawn to most standout element
whatever you want the reader to read first simply make it bigger

bright colours more attention grabbing than muted colour 

"Empty space directs attention by diverting it. Where there’s empty space, there’s nothing. When you look at a poster, you typically expect to see something. So naturally your eye will ignore the contents of the empty space and move straight to wherever the content is situated. "

top left corner gets attention frist , study by eyequant - similar study same result by yahoo
text heavy pages uses gutenberg diagram which describes how the eye looks

2008 study shows that on average only 28% of page is read - need for patterns to show content where the eye goes
another study confirmed which is called the golden triangle

Should position menu at top horizonal or left verical

left side of page gets more attention that the right
