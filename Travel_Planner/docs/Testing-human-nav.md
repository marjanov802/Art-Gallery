This file will be the results of tests to understand what is needed for the next steps in the Travel Planner.
The test will be to present the user with a destination to visit, they will need to plan out the trip from start to finish only using search engines or social media, they have freedom to gather information however they wish.
All the searches, and steps that the participant takes will be recorded.
At a later date the information will be compared across all tests and i will try to understand why certain measures have been taken as well as understanding what needs to be implemented in my page.

Participant 1:
Age 20
Experienced in travelling
Has a method to planning
Dennis Marjanov (Myself) - Brazil

First though was iconic images of Brazil, what is the first thing that comes to mind.
- Long beach in Brazil
- Christ the redeemer
- Carnival
- Football

Searches and results:
Brazil what to do
Brazil carnival when - this includes festivals for other cultures
What city is near some of the activities
Brazil itinerary - 2weeks , 4 weeks etc, duration of the trip
Went on pictures to see what I like, then after that pressed on information depending on information

Once I have chosen all of the things that I would like to do or to see, then I want to see how I would group them, which activities are in close proximity to each other. So then I would check the locations of all of the activities to group them this way, or which ones are easier transportation wise.
This means that I could base them from cities.
EXAMPLE FOR BRAZIL:
Rio De Janeiro - Sugarloaf mountain
Foz do Igua√ßu - Christ the redeemer
The Amazon - Rainforest

The activities listed and the location that I would have to be in meaning I would have to travel from each location to the next.

Next I saw the easiest way to get to Brazil's main cities. And transport between the cities that I would like to see or activities I would want to participate in.


CONCLUSIONS:
Images of activites needed, very visual
Once activites are selected they should be sorted in proximity of area or trips that can be taken from certain major cities.
Distances between the places should be calculated , and method to get there should be know.
