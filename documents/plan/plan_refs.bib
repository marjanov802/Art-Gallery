Background
In a fatal incident in 1984 much discussed in the literature, a patient received 16,000 rads instead of the intended 180 rads when undergoing radiation treatment. This incident likely could have been prevented by the use of risk analysis.
Risk Analysis
Risk analysis techniques to identify use errors have received increasing attention in health care. Use errors are defined as a pattern of predictable human errors that can be attributable to inadequate or improper design. Among the most widely used of the risk analysis tools are Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA). The Therac 25 Radiation Therapy System incidents involved a combination of technical failures (software and possibly hardware) combined with human behavior resulting in catastrophic radiation overdoses.
Summary and Conclusions
From a manufacturer’s perspective, FMEAs and FTAs are valuable methods to systematically evaluate a medical device design’s potential for inducing use errors. When these risk analyses are done early in the development cycle, potential faults and their resulting hazards are identifiable and much easier to mitigate with error-reducing designs. These risk management methods are excellent complements to other important user-centered design best practices.},

	abstract = {The FAA is looking to develop streamlined launch and reentry licensing requirements for the evolving commercial space industry. A central goal is to move from prescriptive requirements to performance requirements. By focusing on outcomes, performance standards give to developers flexibility and make it possible to find lowest-cost means to achieve compliance. Performance standards can generally accommodate technological change and the emergence of new technology driven hazards in ways that prescriptive standards cannot. However, how performance standards are designed and how they are implemented and enforced matters greatly. This paper uses the case of the Boeing B-737 MAX MCAS certification to illustrate the following mistakes to be avoided when using performance-based safety requirements: excessive trust on quantitative performance requirements, inadequate risk-based design process, and lack of independent design verification by experts.},
