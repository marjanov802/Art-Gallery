  abstract   = {Cognitive load is a theoretical notion with an increasingly central role in the educational research literature. The basic idea of cognitive load theory is that cognitive capacity in working memory is limited, so that if a learning task requires too much capacity, learning will be hampered. The recommended remedy is to design instructional systems that optimize the use of working memory capacity and avoid cognitive overload. Cognitive load theory has advanced educational research considerably and has been used to explain a large set of experimental findings. This article sets out to explore the open questions and the boundaries of cognitive load theory by identifying a number of problematic conceptual, methodological and application-related issues. It concludes by presenting a research agenda for future studies of cognitive load.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory has been very influential in educational psychology during the last decade in providing guidelines for instructional design. Whereas numerous empirical studies have used it as a theoretical framework, a closer analysis reveals some fundamental conceptual problems within the theory. Various generalizations of empirical findings become questionable because the theory allows different and contradicting possibilities to explain some empirical results. The article investigates these theoretical problems by analyzing the conceptual distinctions between different kinds of cognitive load. It emphasizes that reduction of cognitive load can sometimes impair learning rather than enhancing it. Cognitive load theory is reconsidered both from the perspective of Vygotski’s concept of the zone of proximal development and from the perspective of research on implicit learning. Task performance and learning are considered as related, but nevertheless fundamentally different processes. Conclusions are drawn for the further development of the theory as well as for empirical research and instructional practice.},

  abstract = {Online shopping is becoming one of the most popular applications on the Internet. Websites are the important interfaces in HCI (Human–Computer Interaction). Website design significantly affects online shopping behavior. This research used eye-tracker to track the eye-movement process for 42 college students when they were surfing websites with different levels of complexity and completing simple and complex tasks respectively. The study examines how website complexity and task complexity jointly affect users' visual attention and behavior due to different cognitive loads. The study fills a research gap by examining this phenomenon from the cognitive load perspective and taking the moderate effect of task complexity into consideration. The results show that task complexity can moderate the effect of website complexity on users' visual attention and behavior. Specifically, when users conducted a simple task, fixation count and task completion time were at the highest level on the website with high complexity, while fixation duration was not significantly different on the websites with different complexity. However, when users conducted a complex task on a website with medium complexity, task completion time, fixation count, and fixation duration were all at their highest level. The load theory of attention was used to provide the explanation for the results. The findings provide guidelines for website managers and designers to maximize users' visual attention.},

  abstract = {In cognitive load theory, element interactivity has been used as the basic, defining mechanism of intrinsic cognitive load for many years. In this article, it is suggested that element interactivity underlies extraneous cognitive load as well. By defining extraneous cognitive load in terms of element interactivity, a distinct relation between intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load can be established based on whether element interactivity is essential to the task at hand or whether it is a function of instructional procedures. Furthermore, germane cognitive load can be defined in terms of intrinsic cognitive load, thus also associating germane cognitive load with element interactivity. An analysis of the consequences of explaining the various cognitive load effects in terms of element interactivity is carried out.},

It is not surprising that companies are interested in gaining the patronage of this group, particularly via the web. Surprisingly, very little research into making web pages appealing to this important demographic has been done. This paper addresses this need through two separate studies. The first, an online survey, provides evidence that our proposed score for predicting the visual appeal of web pages reflects the self report measure of what pages Generation Y likes. To refine these findings, an eye tracking study is conducted using the pages that were most and least liked in Study I. Participants’ eye movement is tracked while browsing these pages, providing evidence of what attracts their attention. The results of these two studies suggest that Generation Y may prefer pages that include a main large image, images of celebrities, little text, and a search feature. This research has important implications.},

Little is known about how colour affects trust or satisfaction on the part of the viewer. Although the Internet is increasingly global, few systematic studies have been undertaken in which the impact of colour on culturally diverse viewers is investigated in website design. In this research three website colour treatments are tested across three culturally distinct viewer groups for their impact on user trust, satisfaction, and e-loyalty. To gather data, a rich multi-method approach is used including eye-tracking, a survey, and interviews. Results reveal that website colour appeal is a significant determinant for website trust and satisfaction with differences noted across cultures. The findings have practical value for web marketers and interface designers concerning effective colour use in website development.},

Color is an essential aspect of art and design; often designers overlook the connotations associated with color. This paper intends to connect the fields of color psychology and HCI, thus explaining how professionals in the field can utilize the advantages of this framework. To study the effects of color within the realm of digital interface design, an experiment was undertaken with the goal of increasing user session time. A hypothesis was derived by assessing demographics, preferences, and trends despite color being traditionally perceived as innately subjective. The data collected from the experiment demonstrated that yellow shades of blue, in combination with a noninvasive color scheme (such as dark mode), can increase the time users spend browsing a webpage.},
