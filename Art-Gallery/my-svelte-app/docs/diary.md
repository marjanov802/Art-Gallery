             Bright colours that attrackt the eye all around the art, want to attrackt the users eye around the page. Single page to keep simple.
             Need to think about how to modify the page for all browsers, upon test scroll bar still shows in other browsers such as firefox.
             Need to justify everything with research i have found for report.
             Copied and pasted a bunch or wrong infroamtion to fill out the page, at the end need to create the artist pages with the correct information.
             
05/03/2025 - I dont like the second checkout i made, i used template looked proffessional however it is too much for HCI.
             I will need to change this as there is too many buttons and screens.

06/03/2025 - Trhough trying ot be creative the website has lost consistency, the checkouts are all different from expereimenetation, new packages and templates taken from flowbite svelte and other pages, i need to make it consistent throughout again.
