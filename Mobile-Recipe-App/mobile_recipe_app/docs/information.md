Creating the welcome page, should i use tap or swipe to start, i think tap considering its for elderly people who struggle with certain motions.
want to make the button attractive in some way for example i could make it pulsate, that invites the user to press the button.
The colour palette before the app has been configured would need to be something very clear and neutral for all users until they have set up to their prefrences, has to look profesional as well so we will stick to certain colour palettes throughout the app other than if they have selected something else.
