Creating the welcome page, should i use tap or swipe to start, i think tap considering its for elderly people who struggle with certain motions.
want to make the button attractive in some way for example i could make it pulsate, that invites the user to press the button.
The colour palette before the app has been configured would need to be something very clear and neutral for all users until they have set up to their prefrences, has to look profesional as well so we will stick to certain colour palettes throughout the app other than if they have selected something else.

Much progress with the developement of the app however now the main.dart page has become to long and complex , especially when adding new features or fixing issues. 
What i will do is break down the files, seperate files for seperate pages , for example the main page main contain the flow or how i will navigate around the site and basic structure but it may just consisst of calling seperate files from outside and around the other files.
for example , main.dart , would call setup.dart when the user reaches the setup page.


Also having second thoughts about the apps login page as elderly people may not want to go through the hassle
